# What is This?

This repository is used to store the HTML files for my [portfolio website](https://www.evanbhandari.com.np). It serves as a web server for my website, and makes everything accesible. 

Currently, I am using GitHub Pages to host my portfolio website, making it accessible to others. (GitHub pages is free and easy to use to host static websites)

Please refrain from copying the code directly for your own use (i spent a lot of time making this). However, you are welcome to take inspiration for your own website!
